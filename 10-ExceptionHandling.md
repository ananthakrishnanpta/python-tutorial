# **Comprehensive Guide to Exception Handling in Python**

Error handling is a vital aspect of programming, ensuring your code can gracefully handle unexpected situations. Python provides a robust framework for managing exceptions, allowing you to identify, handle, and recover from errors effectively.

---

## **What is an Exception?**

An **exception** is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. It occurs when the program encounters something unexpected, such as:

- Dividing by zero.
- Accessing an undefined variable.
- Trying to open a non-existent file.

### **Key Points about Exceptions**
1. Exceptions are runtime errors.
2. They do not crash the program if handled properly.
3. Python provides tools to manage these exceptions gracefully.

---

## **Basic Syntax of Exception Handling**

Python uses `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions.

### **Structure**
```python
try:
    # Code that might cause an exception
except ExceptionType:
    # Code to handle the exception
else:
    # Code to execute if no exceptions occur
finally:
    # Code that always executes, regardless of what happens
```

## **Common Built-in Exceptions in Python**

| **Exception**         | **Description**                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ZeroDivisionError`    | Raised when division by zero is attempted.           |
| `FileNotFoundError`    | Raised when trying to open a file that does not exist.|
| `IndexError`           | Raised when accessing an invalid index in a list.    |
| `KeyError`             | Raised when accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary.|
| `TypeError`            | Raised when an operation is applied to an invalid type.|
| `ValueError`           | Raised when an operation receives an invalid value.  |

## **Detailed Examples of Exception Handling**

### **1. Handling Division by Zero**

#### Example:
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
```

#### Output:
```
Enter a number: 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!
```

---

### **2. File Not Found**

#### Example:
```python
try:
    with open("non_existent_file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found!")
```

#### Output:
```
Error: File not found!
```

---

### **3. Handling Multiple Exceptions**

#### Example:
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter a valid integer!")
```

#### Output:
```
Enter a number: a
Error: Please enter a valid integer!
```

---

### **4. Using `else` Block**

The `else` block executes only if no exceptions occur.

#### Example:
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
    if num < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative numbers are not allowed!")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Great! You entered {num}.")
```

---

### **5. Using `finally` Block**

The `finally` block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not.

#### Example:
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 100 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution complete.")
```

#### Output:
```
Enter a number: 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!
Execution complete.
```

---

### **6. Raising Custom Exceptions**

You can raise exceptions deliberately using the `raise` keyword.

#### Example:
```python
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if age < 18:
        raise ValueError("You must be at least 18 years old.")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Output:
```
Enter your age: 16
Error: You must be at least 18 years old.
```

---

### **7. Creating Custom Exception Classes**

You can define your own exception classes by extending the `Exception` class.

#### Example:
```python
class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    if age < 0:
        raise InvalidAgeError("Age cannot be negative!")
except InvalidAgeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

---

### **8. Nested Try-Except Blocks**

You can nest `try-except` blocks for fine-grained error handling.

#### Example:
```python
try:
    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
        try:
            data = file.read()
            num = int(data)
            print(f"Number from file: {num}")
        except ValueError:
            print("Error: File does not contain a valid number.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found!")
```

---

### **9. Suppressing Exceptions**

You can use `pass` to ignore specific exceptions.

#### Example:
```python
try:
    result = 100 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    pass  # Ignore the error
print("Program continues...")
```

---

### **10. Logging Exceptions**

You can log exceptions to keep track of errors in your application.

#### Example:
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    with open("error_log.txt", "a") as log_file:
        log_file.write(f"Error: {e}\n")
    print("Error logged.")
```

---

## **Best Practices for Exception Handling**

1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except` block.
   ```python
   except ZeroDivisionError:
   ```

2. **Avoid Silencing Exceptions**: Do not use `except: pass` unless necessary.

3. **Log Errors**: Maintain a log of errors for debugging and tracking.

4. **Use `finally` for Cleanup**: Release resources, such as closing files or database connections.

5. **Validate Inputs**: Prevent errors by validating user inputs before processing.

## **Real-Life Example: ATM Withdrawal System**

```python
class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    pass

class InvalidAmountError(Exception):
    pass

def withdraw(balance, amount):
    try:
        if amount <= 0:
            raise InvalidAmountError("Withdrawal amount must be greater than zero.")
        if amount > balance:
            raise InsufficientFundsError("Insufficient balance.")
        balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrawal successful! Remaining balance: {balance}")
    except InvalidAmountError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except InsufficientFundsError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    finally:
        print("Thank you for using the ATM.")

# Example usage
current_balance = 5000
withdraw(current_balance, 6000)  # Attempting to withdraw more than the balance
```
